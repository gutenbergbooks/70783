<div class="pageborder">
<p>1. “This is too lovely weather to stay in the hollow stump bungalow,”
said Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy one day. “I’ll get Uncle Wiggily
to take me for a ride in his automobile.” Going to the door the muskrat
lady housekeeper called: “Wiggy! Oh, Wiggy! Where are you?”
But no answer came, though the car was in plain sight in the yard.
“I wonder if he has gone adventuring by himself?” said Nurse Jane.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>2. Once more the muskrat lady called. And then a voice, faint and
far off answered her: “What do you want?” The muskrat lady nearly
jumped out of her skin. “Where in the world are you, Wiggy?” she
asked. “I’d like you to take me for a ride.” Uncle Wiggily crawled
from beneath the machine. “I have been fixing the car so it would
ride faster and better,” he answered. “I’ll soon be ready for you.”</p>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>3. The rabbit gentleman washed himself clean of oil and black dirt,
and, dressed in his best suit, he started to take Nurse Jane for a ride.
“Maybe we’ll have some adventures,” spoke the muskrat lady. At
first the auto ran along very easily. But, all of a sudden, it reared
up on its hind wheels like a skittish horse and began moving backward.
“Oh, Uncle Wiggily, what did you do to it?” cried Nurse Jane.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i007.jpg" alt="Car on right two wheels">
</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>4. “I didn’t do anything to the auto except fix it,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“Yes, you fixed it all right!” cried Nurse Jane. And just then
the car settled down on all four wheels and began to race around a
tree like playing Ring in the Rosie game. “Oh, what is going to happen
now?” squeaked Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy. Uncle Wiggily held her in
as the car skidded on two wheels. “Don’t jump!” shouted the rabbit.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i008" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i008.jpg" alt="Car on front two wheels">
</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>5. Uncle Wiggily twisted this way and that way on the steering
wheel, and finally the auto stopped skidding around the tree. “Now
I guess we are all right,” laughed the bunny rabbit. “Anyhow, you
wanted some adventures, Nurse Jane, and you are getting them.”
Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy sniffed. “Yes, I’m getting them all right,” she said.
“Oh, what’s it doing now?” she cried, as the auto tilted up again.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>6. By hard work, Uncle Wiggily saved Nurse Jane from falling out
of the car. And by speaking kind words to the machine, and by putting
a little talcum powder on the radiator, the rabbit gentleman at last
got his auto to settle down and jog along as it should do. But, all
of a sudden, as Nurse Jane looked back, wondering how many miles
they had come, she saw the Skillery Skallery Alligator. Oh my!</p>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i010.jpg" alt="Car speeding along with alligator behind">
</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>7. “Ho! Ho!” bellowed the Alligator, opening wide his big mouth.
“I shall soon have some fine ear-nibbles.” Then he flipped his tail and
he flapped his tail and after Uncle Wiggily’s auto the Alligator ran.
“Oh, go fast! Go fast, Uncle Wiggily!” cried Nurse Jane. So the
rabbit uncle made his car go as fast as he could. “I hope it plays
no more tricks,” thought Uncle Wiggily. “If it does, we are lost!”</p>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i011.jpg" alt="Car chasing alligator">
</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>8. All of a sudden, when the Alligator had almost caught Uncle
Wiggily and Nurse Jane, the auto gave a shiver and a shake. “Oh, it’s
going to cut up some more tricks!” cried the rabbit. “Come, Nurse
Jane, we’ll get on the back seat.” And, no sooner were they safe on
the back seat than the automobile turned around, all by itself, and
began to chase the Alligator. “Now it is my turn!” honked the auto.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>9. Faster and faster the auto ran after the Alligator. “Ha! Ha!”
laughed Nurse Jane. “I wonder how the Skillery Skallery chap likes
being chased? Keep on, Auto!” And the auto kept on, until, all of a
sudden, it reached the Alligator, and, bumping the bad chap with the
front wheels, sent the ’Gator flying over the trees. “Ah, now I can
faint safely,” sighed Nurse Jane. And the Squiggle Bugs danced.</p>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>1. One day, after a heavy fall of snow, Uncle Wiggily got out his
snow plow, and, with Curly and Floppy Twistytail, started to plow a
path around the hollow stump bungalow. “Now Nurse Jane can get
out and go to the three and four-cent store,” said the bunny. “I
know someone who can’t get out!” barked Jackie Bow Wow.
“Grandpa Goosey is snowed in!” The bunny said he’d plow him out.</p>

</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>2. “Come, boys!” called Uncle Wiggily to Curly and Floppy, when
he heard that his friend Grandfather Goosey Gander was snowed in.
“We must dig him out.” Off they started and the piggie boys went so
fast that they scattered a shower of snow on either side. “If anyone
was there,” grunted Curly, “we’d snow them under.” Floppy said that
was so. On they went, faster and faster to the pen of Grandpa Goosey.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>3. Reaching the goose gentleman’s house, Uncle Wiggily saw that
it was all snowed in, for there had been a blizzard. “But we’ll soon
make a path for him!” cried Mr. Longears, twinkling his pink nose.
“Lively now, piggie boys!” Around the house they went with the
snow plow, Uncle Wiggily steering it. “Thank you for digging me
out!” quacked Grandpa. “Uncle Butter is next,” mewed Tommie Kat.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>4. “What’s that?” cried Uncle Wiggily as he heard Tommie mewing.
“Your friend Uncle Butter, the goat, is also snowed up,” said Tommie.
“We must snow plow him out!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “Hurry, piggie
boys!” Very soon they came to a big wall of snow. Over the top
they saw a chimney. “Uncle Butter lives there,” said Curly. “But
our plow can never get through all that snow. What shall we do?”</p>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>5. All of a sudden, as Uncle Wiggily and the piggie boys were wondering
how to get Uncle Butter out of his snow-drifted house, there
sounded a loud: “Baa-a-a-a-a!” Then through the snow wall came the
goat gentleman, head first. “How did you get out?” asked Uncle Wiggily,
as the goat flew over his head. “I lowered my horns and I butted
my way through the snow,” bleated the goat. “Now I’ll help you.”</p>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i019" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i019.jpg" alt="Goat and pigs pull snow plow">
</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>6. After Uncle Butter burst his way through the snow, he helped the
piggies pull the snow plow, and they cleared a path around the goat’s
house. “We must dig out more of my friends,” said Uncle Wiggily.
Off they started again, and at last they came to two big heaps of
snow. “Hum!” said the bunny. “Some of my friends must live here,
though I can’t remember who they are. But I’ll plow them out.”</p>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>7. All of a sudden, just as Uncle Wiggily was going to plow around
the two snow mounds, to dig out those whom he thought were his
friends—all at once, from one mound burst the Fox, and from the
other the Wolf. “Ha! Ha!” snickered the bad chaps. “That’s the time
we fooled Uncle Wiggily. He thought we were his friends, but now we
can nibble his ears.” You can imagine how sad Uncle Wiggily felt.</p>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>8. Just as the Fox and Wolf jumped to catch Uncle Wiggily by the
ears, Uncle Butter bleated: “Come on, piggie boys! We’ll fool these
bad chaps. Come on! We’ll scatter snow over them and cover them up
again as they were at first. Then they can’t nibble us!” Off started the
goat gentleman and the piggie boys pulling Uncle Wiggily on the plow.
On either side shot out a stream of snow over the Fox and the Wolf.</p>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>9. “Oh wow!” howled the Fox, as he felt himself being snowed in
again. “Double-wow!” howled the Wolf. “And we get no ear nibbles
after all. It’s all your fault, for being so hasty, Mr. Fox!” Then the
Fox snarled and said: “’Tisn’t at all! It was your fault!” And there
they were, stuck back in snow drifts as before. And then the piggie
boys pulled Uncle Wiggily and Uncle Butter off on the snow plow.</p>

HIS GARDEN AND HIS NEIGHBORS, AND WHEN<br>

</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>1. There had been no rain in a long time, so Uncle Wiggily said:
“I will take the hose and water the garden.” Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy,
in the hollow stump bungalow, heard the bunny gentleman getting
ready to sprinkle. “Be careful,” she warned Uncle Wiggily. “Don’t
get wet and don’t splash any of the neighbors.” The bunny gave a jolly
laugh and said he guessed he knew how to handle a simple little hose.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i025.jpg" alt="Wiggily looking at hose end">
</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>2. Uncle Wiggily unwound the hose, fastened one end to the faucet
and then he turned the nozzle toward the garden, which was very
dry. But the water was a long time coming. “I wonder if the hose
can be stopped up?” thought Uncle Wiggily. “Water ought to be
spurting out by this time. I’ll look down the nozzle and see what’s
the matter. I certainly can’t wet my garden without some water.”</p>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i026" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>3. All of a sudden, when Uncle Wiggily was squinting down the
hose nozzle, the water quickly spurted out. Before the rabbit gentleman
could jump away he got his face full of water. “Oh, my goodness!”
exclaimed Mr. Longears. “I didn’t think it was going to do
that!” In the window of the bungalow Nurse Jane couldn’t help laughing.
“Didn’t I tell you to be careful, Wiggy, my dear!” she called out.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i027.jpg" alt="Wiggily wrapped by hose">
</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>4. Uncle Wiggily began to grow excited. He jumped about and tried
to pull the hose straight so he might water his garden, but the hose
kinked itself around one of his paws. “Oh my!” he cried. “I must be
very careful or I’ll fall and bump my pink nose.” The bunny danced
about, trying to get loose from the hose. But all the while the water
was spurting out, and, as he waved the nozzle, he scattered showers.</p>
</div>
<br>

</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>5. At last Uncle Wiggily hopped out of the kinky loop of the hose,
and he was just going to start watering his garden when up rose Mrs.
Twistytail, the lady pig. “Look what you did to me, Uncle Wiggily!”
she cried, shaking her parasol at him. “I’m soaking wet!” And
the rabbit gentleman was so flustered that he stuck the hose straight
up in the air. Well—what goes up must come down, you know!</p>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>6. “I beg your pardon, Mrs. Twistytail! I really beg your pardon!”
exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. The pig lady grunted and waddled away to
get dry. Then the bunny noticed how wet he, himself, was. “Oh, I
must wring out my coat!” he exclaimed. He laid aside the hose for a
moment, but he never saw that he had pointed it at the open kitchen
window of his bungalow. “Swish!” went the water in the window.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>7. Nurse Jane was in the kitchen, baking a lollypop pie, and when
she felt the water coming in she rushed to the window and cried: “Oh,
stop it, Uncle Wiggily! Stop it!” The rabbit gentleman grew so
excited that he grabbed up the hose and, before he knew it he was
sprinkling Uncle Butter the goat. “Don’t wet me!” bleated Uncle
Butter. “Save the water for the bushy Bear! He’s coming along!”</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>8. “Oh, Uncle Butter! I beg your pardon, also!” cried Uncle Wiggily,
as he saw what he had done. “Never mind about begging pardons,”
bleated the goat. “Get ready for the Bear. He’s right behind
me!” And, surely enough, the Bushy Bear came lumbering around
the corner of the hollow stump bungalow. “Give me some ear
nibbles!” he growled. “Give him the hose!” cried Uncle Butter.</p>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>9. “Ha! That’s a good idea!” exclaimed the bunny as the Bear
made a rush for him. “Good morning, Mr. Bear!” went on Mr. Longears,
politely. “Have you washed your face today? If you haven’t
I’ll wash it for you!” And with that he sozzled the Bear good. “Ha!
Ha!” laughed Uncle Butter. “Do you want any ears to nibble?” The
Bear flopped a somersault, growling: “This is too much! I’ll be good!”</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
